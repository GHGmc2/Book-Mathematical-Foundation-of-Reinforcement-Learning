# Value Function Approximation

## TD learning of state values with function approximation



## TD learning of action values with function approximation



## Deep Q-learning

- or deep Q-network (DQN)
- The basic idea of deep Q-learning is to use the gradient-descent algorithm to minimize the objective function.
- Techniques
  - Two networks, a main network and a target network.
  - Experience replay
